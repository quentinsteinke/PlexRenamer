This is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. The script is a file renaming tool called "Plex Renamer" that allows you to select MKV files from your computer and rename them based on the input fields provided. The GUI includes a list box to display the selected files, buttons to move the selected files up and down in the list, a button to group selected files as "special", and input fields to enter the show name, season number, episode start number, and special start number.

The renaming process is triggered by clicking the "Rename Files" button, which renames the files based on the input provided and prints a success message to the console. The script also handles exceptions such as when no files are selected, no season number is provided, or when a file cannot be renamed. Overall, this script provides a convenient way to batch rename files in a user-friendly way.
